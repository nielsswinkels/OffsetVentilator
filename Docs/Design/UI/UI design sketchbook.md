## Rotate knob with defined positions (one knob for all parameters)
Pros:
* easy to read/understand
Cons:
* Different parameters have different ranges
* When you switch from one parameter to the next, the knob stays in the same position, showing the wrong value. Does it need a pushbutton next to it which you press to actually set the value?
* Does not show which value is currently set

## Endless rotating knob ##
Pros:
* No problems with different ranges
* Together with some kind of display it can show what the current set value is
Cons:
* Needs something that displays the value
